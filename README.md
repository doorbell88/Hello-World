# Hello-World
First Repository - list of ideas, notes, scratch, etc.


My name is Kevin, and I am a mechanical/electrical engineer aspiring to become a software engineer as well.
I am interested in embedded systems, controls, machine learning, and robotics.
One day I would like to work in developing machine learning to help humanity.
Hopefully we can save the world while there's still time!
